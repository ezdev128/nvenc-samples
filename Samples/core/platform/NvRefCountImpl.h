//! \brief Implementation of \e INvRefCount.

//! \e INvRefCount::AddRef() and \e INvRefCount::Release() can be implemented
//! in any way that is suitable for the particular class. The vast majority
//! of classes will choose to use the implementation contained in this module.
//! This implementation of \e INvRefCount is as follows:
//! \li 1) Ref count is initialized to 1 when the object is created.
//! \li 2) Ref count is incremented by 1 on \e AddRef().
//! \li 3) Ref count is decremented by 1 on \e Release().
//! \li 4) When ref count goes to 0, delete is called on the object.
//!
//! The \e AddRef() and \e Release() methods are defined in the
//! \e INVREFCOUNT_IMPL macro.
//!
//! There is also a debugging tool in this implementation that will catch
//! any open references when the application quits. \e DumpRefCounts() can be
//! called on application exit to determine the number of open references
//! that show some \e Release() calls were missed by the application.
//!
//! Typical use of \e INvRefCountImpl would be:
//! \code
//! class foo : public virtual INvRefCountImpl {
//! public:
//!    INVREFCOUNT_IMPL
//! \endcode
class INvRefCountImpl : public virtual INvRefCount

        //!   This is identical to the default constructor because a "copy" is a new object so
        //!   its reference count is exactly like a newly constructed object, not a copy of the old object.
