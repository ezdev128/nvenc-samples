//! \brief Base abstract interface for all reference counted classes.

//! \e INvRefCount is the base abstract interface for all reference counted classes.
//! Each class that inherits from \e INvRefCount must implement \e AddRef()
//! and \e Release(). When a reference counted class is created, the initial
//! reference count will be 1. Whenever a new variable points to that class
//! the application should call \e AddRef() after assignment. Each time the
//! variable is destroyed, \e Release() should be called. On each \e AddRef()
//! the reference count is incremented. On each \e Release() the reference
//! count is decremented. When the reference count goes to 0 the object is
//! automatically destroyed.
//!
//! An implementation of INvRefCount is provided by \e INvRefCountImpl.
//! Application developers will typically use \e INvRefCountImpl instead of
//! deriving new objects from \e INvRefCount.
