//! \file NvTypes.h
//! \brief Platform independent types.
//!
//! NvTypes.h contains the base types used to construct more abstract data
//! types. This file is necessary because different machines and compilers
//! may apply a different number of bits precision to the C/C++ types \c int,
//! \c unsigned, \c short, \c signed and \c char. Use the platform independent
//! types defined in this module in most if not all places. Use of \c int, and
//! other built in types should only be used within an algorithm where compiled
//! speed is more important.
