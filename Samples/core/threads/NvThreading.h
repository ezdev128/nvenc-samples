//! \brief Platform independent threading and thread synchronization.
//!
//! The \e INvThreading interface is an operating system abstraction for
//! threading and synchronization facilities. This allows a single application
//! that uses the features to be compiled to run on a number of platforms that
//! implement this interface.
//! The developer may use these methods directly or refer to
//! \e NvThreadingClasses.h for C++ wrappers that make using \e INvThreading
//! much more convenient.

        //! data structure should be protected so a thread can complete
        //! its change before another accesses the data. It is common to use
        //! mutex for this. Access to the data structure should be protected
